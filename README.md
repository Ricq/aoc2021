# Ricq's Advent of Code 2021 work

My personal work on the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) puzzle competition.

## Building

Open in IntelliJ or use SBT

## Usage

Choose the puzzle by changing the called method in `Main.scala`. Then run as a command-line application.

## Contributing
My personal space. I won't be working together with others. Suggestions are void.
Be free to pull as you want, although solving the puzzles yourselves is probably better.
